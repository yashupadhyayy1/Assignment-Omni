# LangSmith Evaluation Report

**Generated:** 2025-09-11 02:35:18  
**Project:** Assignment Omni - AI Agent Pipeline

## Overview

This report documents the evaluation of the Assignment Omni AI agent pipeline using LangSmith. The evaluation assesses the performance of both weather API integration and RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) functionality.

## Evaluation Setup

### Test Queries
The evaluation includes 13 test queries covering:

- **Weather Queries (5)**: Temperature, weather conditions, forecasts
- **RAG Queries (5)**: Document summarization, content analysis
- **Edge Cases (3)**: General queries, ambiguous requests

### Evaluation Metrics

1. **Response Quality Metrics:**
   - Length appropriateness
   - Completeness
   - Clarity
   - Relevance

2. **LLM-Based Metrics:**
   - Accuracy
   - Helpfulness
   - Coherence
   - Completeness

3. **Routing Accuracy:**
   - Correct weather vs RAG classification
   - Success rate
